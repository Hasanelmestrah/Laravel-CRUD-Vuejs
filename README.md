#Dear Mr. Ahmad,

I hope you're doing well. I've been working hard on the task for the past three days, giving it my all to meet the requirements. Unfortunately, I ran into some problems that took more time to fix than I expected, so the work isn't as good as I'd like it to be.

I understand the importance of delivering high-quality work, and I'm determined to make things right. If you decide to accept my internship application, I'll do everything I can to meet the company's needs.

Thanks for understanding, and I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to the team.

Best regards,
Hasan El-Mestrah
